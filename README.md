# Project Description
Welcome to the KTM-Mart eCommerce Website Project!

This collaborative project aims to build a dynamic and fully functional eCommerce website using a blend of front-end and back-end technologies. The website will be designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. The back-end will be powered by Java and SQL to manage data efficiently and handle business logic.

Our goal is to create a seamless shopping experience, complete with product listings, user authentication, a shopping cart, and secure checkout processes. We will be following best practices in web development to ensure that the website is scalable, secure, and easy to maintain.
